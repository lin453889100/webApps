1.Project Description - What is the high-level idea of your project? This should be similar to your daily log submission (but could have changed).

The high-level idea of my project will be creating a video sharing website(similar to mobile app Vine), which allows the user to upload their videos(max 15 seconds). Other users can follow and make comment them and give their video likes. The website will sort the ranking of the video based on the number of likes and comments. Also, video uploaders can add hashtags to their video and users is able to reach the hashtag.

Project Design - lower-level description. What technologies will you use, how will they integrate?

I will use Netbeans Spring MVC to construct the backstage handling, eventlisteners ...etc, SQL database manager to store the data that user has created.

What are the projectâ€™s use cases?

It is designed to provide quality content that uploaded from the users for other people to see. For entertainment purposes, or based on the content of the video.
Any other design docs that are necessary for me to understand your project

It is similar to Reddit, but only for short video sharing.

Project Schedule - what will you have done at each checkpoint? What will the final project look like?

Checkpoint 1:

Finish the overall HTML/CSS design for the Website
Coding for the login/register functionalities
Checkpoint 2:

Coding for Like/Comment functionalities
Combine the code with the HTML/CSS
Make sure it's running on the localshot
Checkpoint 3:

Able to upload the video
Sorting function based on likes and comments of the videos

Project Justification - why is your project interesting?

It is similar to the Reddit but only includes the video sharing. It will contain a much cleaner layout, easy to view the contents. And it will be a great project to showcase my existing knowledge of Spring MVC, also extending my experience with HTML/ Website design.
